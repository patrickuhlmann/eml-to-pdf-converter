## EML to PDF Converter (Email to PDF Converter) [![Actions Status](https://github.com/nickrussler/eml-to-pdf-converter/workflows/Check,%20Build/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nickrussler/eml-to-pdf-converter/actions)

This software can be used to convert eml files (emails as plain text in MIME format) to pdf files. It can be used as a library, command line tool or desktop application with its GUI.

The conversion is done by parsing (and cleaning) the mime/structure, converting it to html and then using [wkhtmltopdf](//github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf) to convert the generated html to a pdf file.

It also handles inline images, corrupt mime headers and can use a proxy.

### Download
You can download the lates binaries [**here**](//github.com/nickrussler/eml-to-pdf-converter/releases/latest).

There you can find a Windows setup.exe and a jar.<br>
If you want to use the jar (e.g. for a non Windows OS) you need the [wkhtmltopdf](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/) binary in the PATH.

### How to build
You need to git clone this repository. The build will fail if you remove the .git folder (e.g. download this as zip from github).

 * `gradlew shadowJar` <br>
Creates a single self contained Jar in `build/libs`

 * `gradlew dist` <br>
Same as `gradlew shadowJar` but additionally creates windows exe launchers in `build/libs` for gui and console mode. This task needs the [Launch4j](http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/) binary in the PATH.

 * `gradlew innosetup` <br>
Creates a windows setup in `build/innosetup`. This task needs the [Launch4j](http://launch4j.sourceforge.net/) binary as well as the [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php) issc.exe in the PATH.

 * `gradlew check` <br>
Executes the unit tests and generates various reports (jacoco, checkstyle, findbugs, jdepend, unit test report).
